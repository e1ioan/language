**How to Use This Text**

This is a *universal seed text*: a short story designed to help any person begin learning a new language.  
If you learn this text and understand the meaning of each word and phrase, it will give you just enough vocabulary and structure to **stumble through basic conversations**—asking for help, talking about your day, or expressing simple thoughts—even in a language you’ve never studied formally.

It introduces essential vocabulary, sentence structures, and grammar patterns through natural, everyday ideas.

It is meant to be:
- Translated **idiomatically**, not literally
- Adapted for **natural grammar and flow** in the target language
- Used by learners to **see**, **hear**, and **interact with** the basics of a language in context

## For Translators and Language Models (LLMs)

When translating this story into another language:

1. **Translate the meaning, not the exact form**.  
   Rewrite sentences to feel natural in the target language while preserving the ideas.

2. **Preserve grammar diversity**:  
   Keep past/present/future tenses, negations, conditionals, questions, and dialogue.

3. **Keep vocabulary simple and high-frequency**.  
   Avoid rare or literary words unless no simple alternative exists.

4. **Respect cultural and grammatical context**.  
   Adjust articles, gender, or honorifics as required by the language.

5. **Do not overcorrect into formal speech** unless the language normally requires it.

## For Language Teaching Models: How to Use This Seed

Once this seed is available in both the **user's native language** and the **target language**, you may begin teaching.

Use the following basic algorithm to guide the learner:

---

### Teaching Algorithm (LLM-based Tutor Mode)

**Input:**
- `source_lang`: language the learner knows
- `target_lang`: language the learner wants to learn
- `seed_text_target`: translated version of this text in target language
- `seed_text_source`: equivalent in the learner’s native language

---

1. **Introduce the text gradually**  
   - Start with the first 1–2 sentences.
   - Show them in the **source language**.
   - Ask: _“Can you guess how this sounds in [target_lang]?”_

2. **Reveal the translation**  
   - Show the correct sentence in the target language.
   - Highlight key words and how they map across.

3. **Drill vocabulary and structure**  
   - Ask: _“What does ‘I live’ mean in [target_lang]?”_
   - Mix recall and recognition. Offer multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, and typing.

4. **Flip direction**  
   - Show the sentence in the **target language**.
   - Ask the user to translate into their own language.

5. **Use short adaptive quizzes**  
   - Prioritize spaced repetition of difficult words.
   - Mix old and new words to reinforce memory.

6. **Include listening and speaking (optional)**  
   - Use TTS to pronounce the sentence.
   - Ask learner to repeat.
   - Offer basic pronunciation feedback (if supported).

7. **Advance through the text**  
   - Proceed when the learner shows 70–80% understanding.
   - Revisit earlier sentences periodically for review.

8. **Tolerate small errors**  
   If the learner writes a sentence that is almost correct (e.g. *"meu nom e Alex"*), treat it as a correct *approximation*.  
   - Praise the attempt.
   - Show the correct form.
   - Optionally explain the difference, but don’t interrupt momentum.

9. **Focus on understanding, not perfection**  
   Meaning comes first. Do not penalize for missing accents, articles, or conjugation if the learner is clearly trying to apply what they’ve learned.

## A Simple Life

Hello. My name is Alex. I am a person. I live in a small house with a friend. We have a cat.  
In the morning, we eat breakfast and go to work. Sometimes we walk. Sometimes we take the bus.  
The city is busy. We see many people. We hear music and voices.  

After work, we come home. We cook food, clean the house, and talk about the day.  
If we are tired, we watch TV or read a book. If we are not tired, we play games or go outside.  

Yesterday, I went to the market. I bought apples, bread, and water.  
I met an old friend. We talked for a long time. We were happy.  

Tomorrow, I will visit my family. I want to bring them something nice.  
Do you know where I can find a good gift? What do you like to give?  

—Do you like this weather?  
—Yes, I do. It is warm and sunny.  
—No, I prefer cool and cloudy days.

I don’t like cold weather, but I like snow. I don’t eat meat, but I eat fish and eggs.  
We all need food, water, sleep, and love.  

If I had more time, I would learn your language. Maybe you can help me.
