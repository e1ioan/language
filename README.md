**How to Use This Text**

This is a universal seed text: a short, simple story designed to introduce high-frequency vocabulary and essential grammar in any language.

It works best when:
- Translated **idiomatically**, not word-for-word
- Adjusted for **natural flow**, **tense**, **politeness**, and **grammar norms** of the target language
- Used as a **starting point** for language learners to see how everyday ideas are expressed

**Instructions for Translators and Language Models (LLMs)**

When translating this text into another language, follow these rules:

1. **Translate the *meaning*, not the form.**  
   Preserve the intent, tone, and simplicity. If a direct translation sounds unnatural, rewrite it to match how native speakers would express the same idea.

2. **Preserve diversity of structures.**  
   Maintain different tenses (past, present, future), conditionals ("if we are tired…"), negations ("I don’t eat meat…"), and questions. These are essential for grammar exposure.

3. **Keep the character neutral.**  
   If needed for grammar (e.g. gendered languages), adapt the character name or use appropriate forms but keep the context simple and human.

4. **Prioritize clarity over exactness.**  
   Don’t be afraid to change word order or phrasing if the original sounds awkward in your language. For example:
   - “I met an old friend” → “An old friend and I met” is fine if more natural.
   - “Do you like this weather?” → adapt to local ways of asking preferences.

5. **Avoid rare or literary words.**  
   Keep the vocabulary grounded in everyday speech.

6. **Respect cultural context.**  
   If any reference doesn’t make sense culturally, substitute with something equivalent (e.g. “TV” can be replaced with another common evening activity if needed).

## A Simple Life

Hello. My name is Alex. I am a person. I live in a small house with a friend. We have a cat.  
In the morning, we eat breakfast and go to work. Sometimes we walk. Sometimes we take the bus.  
The city is busy. We see many people. We hear music and voices.  

After work, we come home. We cook food, clean the house, and talk about the day.  
If we are tired, we watch TV or read a book. If we are not tired, we play games or go outside.  

Yesterday, I went to the market. I bought apples, bread, and water.  
I met an old friend. We talked for a long time. We were happy.  

Tomorrow, I will visit my family. I want to bring them something nice.  
Do you know where I can find a good gift? What do you like to give?  

—Do you like this weather?  
—Yes, I do. It is warm and sunny.  
—No, I prefer cool and cloudy days.

I don’t like cold weather, but I like snow. I don’t eat meat, but I eat fish and eggs.  
We all need food, water, sleep, and love.  

If I had more time, I would learn your language. Maybe you can help me.
