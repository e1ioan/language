## What this text is

This is a **language seed text**.

It is a small, self-contained story built from words and sentence patterns that appear very often in everyday speech. It uses simple ideas like home, work, food, weather, time, and asking for help, because these exist in every human culture and every language.

The text is not meant to teach a language fully. It is meant to give you a **starting structure**, enough to recognize patterns and begin forming your own sentences.

## How to use it

1. **Translate it line by line** into the language you want to learn.
   Use a dictionary or native help. Do not rush. Make sure you understand each word and why it is used.

2. **Read it aloud**, even if your pronunciation is bad.
   Speaking trains your mouth and ears, not just your memory.

3. **Memorize the meaning, not the exact words.**
   The goal is to recognize patterns like:

   * I am / you are
   * I go / I went / I will go
   * I like / I don’t like
   * Can you help me?

4. **Replace parts of the text with your own life.**
   Change:

   * the city
   * the food
   * the job
   * the weather
     This turns passive reading into active language use.

5. **Use the questions in real situations.**
   Even one correct sentence is enough to start a conversation.

## What to expect

After working with this text, you will not “know” the language.
But you will be able to:

* ask simple questions,
* describe your day,
* understand basic answers,
* and learn faster from real conversations.

This text is a **first foothold**, not a ladder.
Once you can stand, you move.

# A Simple Life

Hello. My name is Alex. I am a person.  
I live in a small house. I live there with a friend.  
We have a cat. The cat is small and calm.

In the morning, I wake up. I eat breakfast.  
My friend eats breakfast too.  
Then we go to work.  
Sometimes we walk. Sometimes we take the bus.

The city is busy.  
There are many people.  
I see people. I hear music and voices.  

My friend works in an office. She likes her job.  
I work near my home. It is quiet there.

After work, we come home.  
We cook food. We clean the house.  
We talk about the day.

If I am tired, I watch TV or read a book.  
If I am not tired, I play games or go outside.

Yesterday, I went to the market.  
I bought apples, bread, and water.  
I met an old friend there.  
We talked for a long time.  
We were happy.

Today, I am a little tired.  
I am hungry.  
I need food and rest.

Tomorrow, I will visit my family.  
They live far away.  
I want to bring them something nice.

Excuse me.  
Can you help me?  
Where can I find a good gift?  
How much is it?

Do you like this weather?  

Yes, I do. It is warm and sunny.  
No, I like cool and cloudy days.

I don’t like cold weather.  
I like snow.

I don’t eat meat.  
I eat fish and eggs.

Sometimes I don’t understand people.  
Please speak slowly.  
Can you say that again?

I want to learn your language.  
I am learning now.  
Maybe you can help me.  

Thank you.
